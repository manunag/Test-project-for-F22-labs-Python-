The game engine first selects a code (string) of a certain length at random (and does not disclose this to the
player).
The player is allowed certain number of guesses to strategically guess the code.
After each guess, the game engine informs the player of the following:
1. Number of characters that are correct, but in the wrong place and
2. Number of characters that are correct and in the correct place.

Number of total guesses = 20
The characters in the String are not Repeated
